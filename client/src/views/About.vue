    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>We are a small dev shop / agency out of Los Angeles. We made this app, because we thought it was a fun thing to do. The printing is done by <a href="https://www.customcat.com/" target=_blank>Custom Cat</a>, they have great prices and an API to hook this up. We take a margin, very minimal on top of the price Custom Cat is billing us.</p>
